## 🔍 Why Use Spring Data AOT?

Spring Data AOT improves performance and reduces errors in applications. Here are a few key benefits:

### 1. ⏩ Faster Performance

With traditional Spring Data, your application spends time creating queries at runtime. This can slow down your app start time. Spring Data AOT prepares everything during the build process, making your app start faster.

### 2. ✅ Fewer Errors

Errors can slip through while your application runs. They often occur due to minor mistakes in query methods. For example, a typo in `findByName` may cause your app to crash when a customer uses it. 

With AOT, these errors get caught early. Your application will not build until you fix them. This means you can focus on building features, not fixing crashes.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before installing, make sure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS, or a recent version of a Linux distribution.
- **Java Version:** JDK 11 or above must be installed. You can download it from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## 🛠 Features

The Spring Data AOT app has several features that make it beneficial for your data processing:

- **Compile-Time Query Processing:** Speed up your application by handling queries before it runs.
- **Detailed Error Reporting:** Get feedback on mistakes before your app goes live.
- **Easy Setup:** Ideal for users without deep programming knowledge.
